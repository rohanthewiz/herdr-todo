# herdr-todo

A **prompt backlog** for [herdr](https://herdr.dev). Jot down prompts of future
work, then — when you're ready — fuzzy-pick one and **drop it straight into a
Claude Code session**: an already-running one herdr has detected, or a brand-new
one it spins up for you in the current project.

It's a herdr plugin built the same way as
[herdr-plus](https://github.com/cloudmanic/herdr-plus): a small Go binary herdr
drives via subcommands, a Bubble Tea TUI in a herdr-managed pane, and the herdr
socket API to create panes and type into them.

## What it does

- **Two backlogs.** A per-project backlog lives in `<repo>/.herdr-todo/todos.json`
  (commit it, and it travels with the repo). A global backlog lives in herdr's
  per-plugin config dir and is visible everywhere. The list groups them
  `Project` / `Global` when both have entries.
- **Manage prompts.** Add (`ctrl+a`), edit (`ctrl+e`), mark done (`ctrl+t`),
  delete (`ctrl+x`). Type to fuzzy-filter. Each prompt has an optional title and
  a multi-line body.
- **Drop into Claude Code.** Highlight a prompt, press `enter`, and pick a target:
  - **A running session** — herdr tags panes with the agent running in them, so
    every Claude Code pane (and other agents) shows up automatically.
  - **A new session** — opens a new tab in the current project's workspace and
    launches `claude`.
- **You choose submit behavior per drop.**
  - `enter` — *paste, don't run*: types the prompt into Claude Code's input but
    doesn't submit, so you can review/edit and press Enter yourself.
  - `ctrl+r` — *drop & run*: submits it so Claude starts working immediately.

## Install

### Local development (this checkout)

```sh
herdr plugin link .
```

herdr runs the `[[build]]` step (`scripts/build.sh`, a `go build`) and registers
the `Herdr Todo: Prompts` action. After code changes:

```sh
make relink     # rebuild + unlink + link
```

### From GitHub

```sh
herdr plugin install rohanthewiz/herdr-todo
```

Requires Go 1.26+ to build from source.

## Use

Bind a key to the **`Herdr Todo: Prompts`** action, or run it from herdr's action
menu. Inside the manager:

| Stage   | Keys |
|---------|------|
| List    | `enter` drop · `ctrl+a` add · `ctrl+e` edit · `ctrl+t` toggle done · `ctrl+x` delete · type to filter · `esc` clear filter / quit |
| Form    | `tab` switch field · `ctrl+s` save · `ctrl+g` toggle Project/Global (when adding) · `esc` cancel |
| Target  | `enter` paste (don't submit) · `ctrl+r` drop & run · `esc` back |

## How the "drop" works

- **Existing pane:** the prompt is sent to that pane via herdr's
  `pane.send_input` (a real Enter key in run mode; no key in paste mode).
- **New session:** a tab is created in the project workspace
  (`tab.create`), then:
  - *run mode* launches `claude <prompt>` — Claude Code takes a leading prompt
    argument and starts working on it immediately;
  - *paste mode* launches bare `claude`, waits for its input UI to draw, then
    types the prompt without submitting.

## Layout

```
main.go      subcommand dispatch (todo / todo-ui / version)
launch.go    the `todo` action (opens the UI pane) + the `todo-ui` runner
ui.go        the Bubble Tea manager (list / form / confirm / target stages)
store.go     project + global JSON-backed todo storage
drop.go      sending a prompt to an existing pane or a new claude session
herdr.go     herdr unix-socket JSON-RPC client (adapted from herdr-plus)
context.go   launch-context plumbing (adapted from herdr-plus)
fuzzylist.go reusable fuzzy list TUI component (adapted from herdr-plus)
styles.go    lipgloss palette
util.go      small helpers
```
